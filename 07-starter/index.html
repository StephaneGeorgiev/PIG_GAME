      <h1>
        Wellcome to 🐷 game! <br />
        The rules are:
      </h1>
      <p>
        One a turn, a player rolls the die 🎲 repeatedly. The goal is to
        accumulate many points as possible, adding up (hold) the numbers rolled
        on the die 🎲. However, if a player rolls a <span>1</span>, the player`s
        turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are
        lost. Rolling a <span>1</span> doesn`t delete your entire score from
        previous turns, just the total earned during that particular roll. A
        player has to chose to hold (stop rolling the die 🎲) if they do not
        want to take a chance to of rollin a <span>1</span> and losing all of
        their points from this turn. If a player chooses to hold 📥, all of the
        points rolled during that turn are added to his score. When a player
        reaches a total of <span>100</span> points, the game end and the player
        is the winner.
